# NRF24L01-Based-STM32-Sensor-Node-with-ESP32-Gateway-Integration

This project demonstrates how to monitor sensor data wirelessly using an NRF24L01-based STM32 Sensor Node and an ESP32 Wi-Fi Gateway.
The system collects environmental data from the sensor node and uploads it to the ThingSpeak Cloud Server for real-time monitoring.

### Hardwar Requirement
- ESP32 Board
- STM32 Microcontroller	
- NRF24L01 PA+LNA
- BME280 Barometric Pressure Sensor	
-	Power Supply 5V	
-	Connecting Wires	
- Breadboard	
## Sensor Node Circuit

This project demonstrates a sensor node using an STM32F103C Bluepill microcontroller with an NRF24L01 module. Any sensor can be interfaced, but for this demo, a BME280 Barometric Pressure Sensor is used.
