# NRF24L01-Based-STM32-Sensor-Node-with-ESP32-Gateway-Integration

This project demonstrates how to monitor sensor data wirelessly using an NRF24L01-based STM32 Sensor Node and an ESP32 Wi-Fi Gateway.
The system collects environmental data from the sensor node and uploads it to the ThingSpeak Cloud Server for real-time monitoring.
